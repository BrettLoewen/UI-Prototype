# UI Prototype

## What is this?

This repo is a prototype for learning Godot's UI system. I figured I would split this into it's own repo so that I could reference it directly without needing to untangle it from the wider game if I wanted to revisit this and use the system in a different game.

## Running

-   Download Godot 4.2 [here](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/)
    -   If you want to work with C#, download the .NET version. Otherwise download the regular version. This project does not use C# so this is not necessary.
-   Extract the downloaded zip folder
    -   The file you care about is `Godot_v4.2-stable_win64`. This is the Godot executable. Feel free to rename it
    -   If you downloaded the .NET version, you need to keep the executable in the same folder as the GodotSharp folder
    -   Create a shortcut to the executable or pin it to the Start menu and/or taskbar if you want
-   Run Godot
-   Select the import option and follow the prompts to find this project
-   Once imported, open the project
-   Once opened, run the game by pressing the run button in the top right corner of the editor
